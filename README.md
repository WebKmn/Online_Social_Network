# Online_Social_Network

# Project Description
Created three static html web pages for a social networking web app with styling done via bootstap and some css, javascript added for some minor form validation. A sign-up page with a form that a potential user will fill to create an account. A sign-in page that will act as the landing page, and a draft of a potential home page once the user signs in. The home page contains dummy data such as posts from other users, links to follow, and trending posts.
