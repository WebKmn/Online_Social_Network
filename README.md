# Online_Social_Network

# Project Description
Created three static html web pages for a social networking web app with styling done via bootstap and some css, javascript added for some minor form validation. A sign-up page with a form that a potential user will fill to create an account. A sign-in page that will act as the landing page, and a draft of a potential home page once the user signs in. The home page contains dummy data such as posts from other users, links to follow, and trending posts. 

# Report

Future plans: implement the functionality for users to post and follow other users and see followed user's posts.
Launching the server: run _npm install_, then _node seed.js_, and finally _npm start_
